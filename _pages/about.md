Hi, I'm Brandon! I graduated from UCLA in 2020 with a B.S. in Math of Computation. Previously, I worked on deep learning
for space applications as a SWE at [Centauri/KBR](https://www.kbr.com/en/centauri-now-kbr). Now I'm a SWE working on
Google Ads at Google.

At different points in my life, I've been focused on different activities in my free time. Some things I used to do a
lot of include: camping and backpacking, musical theater, and improv comedy. Check out the now tab for what I'm up to
now.
