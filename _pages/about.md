![Me!]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/brandon.jpg)

I recently graduated from UCLA with a B.S. in Mathematics of Computation. I'm now a software engineer
specializing in machine learning applications at [Centauri](https://www.centauricorp.com/). I'm interested 
in applying machine learning (and specifically deep learning) to practical problems.

Outside of programming, you can catch me performing improv comedy, reading nonfiction, or lifting weights. :)
