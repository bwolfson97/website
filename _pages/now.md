## Work

I just started my new job as a SWE at Google! I'm really excited for everything I'll learn, as well as for the 
extracurricular oppurtunities at Gooogle. I'm about to start my engineering orientation.

## Hobbies

I want to let go of some of my old extracurriculars and start something new. Some ideas I have are learning an
instrument, singing lessons, and teaching my dog tricks.

## Moving

At some point I plan to move out from home and up to Mountain View for Google, but I'm unsure when I'll do that, given
that there's no return-to-work date set right now. I think I will wait a bit until a return-to-work date is set and I
can see what happens with Omicron, and then go from there. I'm excited to move out at some point though and resume a
normal social life :).

## Workout

I want to start doing some regular cardio, so I've been doing ~3 runs a week right now through the Couch To 5K app. I
did this program my Sophomore year and enjoyed it.
