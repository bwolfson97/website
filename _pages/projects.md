Here is a sampling of some projects I've done outside of work. Enjoy! :)

### [Plant Pathology Classifier][Plant GitHub]
![A leaf]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/leaf.jpg)

I built and deployed a neural network that classifies diseases of plants based on images of their leaves. I
did this project because I've been learning Fast.ai and PyTorch in my free time and wanted to apply my
knowledge somewhere. This data was from the Kaggle [Plant Pathology 2020 - FGVC7](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7/overview)
competition. I then deployed my classifier to the web using a simple [web app][Plant App] I
created with Streamlit.

### [Modeling COVID-19 Prevalence in US Prisons][Modeling COVID]
![Graph]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modeling-covid-graph.png)

In this project, I used Python, the Epidemics on Networks (EoN) Python package, and Jupyter Notebooks to
explore the effects of various interventions on the spread of COVID-19 in US prisons. This project was
done as the final project of my UCLA *Introduction to Networks* course. It was a group project, with my
group being me, Marcel Burgunder, Emma Broback, and Sam Briante. I did most of the coding and some
writing. Marcel did some coding and lots of writing. Read our results [here][Modeling COVID Report].
